Stopping smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid secondhand smoke too.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/live-well/alcohol-support/tips-on-cutting-down-alcohol/\">Cut down on alcohol</a> - drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time. It makes heart failure worse too. Try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no\nmore than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint\nof lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/live-well/exercise\">Exercise</a> - regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It doesn't need to be too energetic - walking every day is enough.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/\">Eat well</a> - aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and veg, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to <a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/tips-for-a-lower-salt-diet/\">cut down on salt</a> too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure - the more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-stress/\">Deal with stress</a> - when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help keep stress at bay.</li>\n<li>Vaccinations - if you have <a href=\"/conditions/heart-failure/\">heart failure</a>, it's recommended that you have a <a href=\"/conditions/vaccinations/flu-influenza-vaccine/\">flu jab</a> every year and a pneumonia vaccination (also called <a href=\"/conditions/vaccinations/pneumococcal-vaccination/\">the pneumococcal vaccine</a>) every 5 years. Ask your doctor about these vaccinations. You can have them free on the NHS.</li>\n</ul>\n",
